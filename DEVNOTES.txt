Description: developer's notes for general reference when extending Mura/CW functionality
CWMURA [edit]: new file 
==========================================================

// ------------------//
// DEVELOPER'S NOTES //
// ------------------//

This is not intended as a thorough documentation, but rather a general outline of steps
for developers wishing to extend the available plugin content options.

Custom CentLogic content can be added via the mura tag, or by using the content objects tab.
Most of the content available in CentLogic is already included in the default list of Display Objects.
SEE README.TXT for General Usage instructions including displaying CentLogic Content Objects on a Mura site.

------------------
METHODS / OVERVIEW 
------------------

Adding new CW functionality to Mura

The eventhandler.cfc holds the functions that displays the actual content, 
as well as a method to inject those functions into the mura events system.
These methods can be called inside the [mura] tag (see readme.txt)

To create custom objects which can be placed on the page via the Content Objects tab,
a content object must be defined in config.xml.cfm. This invokes the function defined in eventHandler.cfc, 
as well as the configurator which allows the user to select options when placing the content object on a Mura page.

Extensions to existing Display Methods, Content Objects, and other 
CentLogic-integrated functionality are encouraged, and your feedback is always appreciated.
